# Default MIRISim dither pattern for LRS.
# 
# The dither offsets for point sources are defined in 
# "The Mid Infrared Instrument for JWST, X: Operations and Data Reduction",
# K. Gordon et al, 2015, PASP 127, 696-711. (For extended sources no dither but nodding to an empty field is forseen.) 
# In paragraph 2.8 it is stated: "...a point source is dithered between positions that are located 1/3 and 2/3 
# along the slit direction", that means an offset of +- 7 columns from the slit center defined in the LRS wavelength and
# distortion CDP file (4.7" slit with 0.11" pixel size corresponds to app. 42 pixels slit extension).
# Offsets are defined in the Imager detector plane and are tabulated as column, row offsets (in units of pixels).
